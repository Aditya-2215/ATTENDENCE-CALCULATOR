## ðŸ“Š Attendance Calculation Formula

The **attendance percentage** is calculated based on total lectures, absences, and any OAA credits as follows:

\[
\text{Attendance \%} = 100 - \left( \frac{\text{Total Absent} - \text{OAA}}{\text{Total Lectures}} \times 100 \right)
\]

### Explanation:

- **Total Lectures** â€“ Total number of classes conducted.  
- **Total Absent** â€“ Number of classes the student missed.  
- **OAA (Other Activity Attendance)** â€“ Absences covered by academic activities (seminars, workshops, etc.) that **do not count** as true absence.  
- **Attendance %** â€“ Final percentage of classes attended.

### ðŸ’° Fine Calculation

If the **attendance percentage** falls below the minimum threshold of **90%**, a fine is applied as:

\[
\text{Fine (â‚¹)} = (\text{90 - Attendance \%}) \times 400
\]

**Notes:**

- Each **1% below 90%** incurs a **â‚¹400 fine**.  
- If attendance â‰¥ 90%, **no fine is applied**.  

### Example

| Total Lectures | Total Absent | OAA | Attendance % | Fine (â‚¹) |
|----------------|--------------|-----|--------------|-----------|
| 340            | 10           | 0   | 97.06%       | 0         |
| 340            | 40           | 0   | 88.24%       | 7040      |
